\section{Data storage and visualization}
    
    As can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:thePicture} the Report fragment has now a two switch tab
    that allows the user to select the time chunks for the chart in the same View.
    
\subsection{fragment\_report.xml}\label{subsec:fragment_report.xml}
        The first thing I needed to was to add was the \textbf{TabLayout} in file
        \textit{fragment\_report.xml}.

    \lstinputlisting[
        firstline=10,
        lastline=16,
        firstnumber=10,
        caption=\texttt{\codepath/res/layout/fragment\_report.xml}
        ,label={lst:frag}
    ]{\codepath/res/layout/fragment_report.xml}
    
    I also rename the \textbf{AnyChartView} from \textit{hourBarChart} to \textit{barChart}
        since it will now follow a double purpose not only for hourly display but also for daily
        count of steps.
